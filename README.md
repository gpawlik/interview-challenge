# Feedr Technical Challenge

Thank you for taking the time to attempt this challenge.

These tests are used to evaluate candidates of all skill levels so please complete them to a level you feel is an accurate representation of your skill set.

Please read `README-FRONTEND.md` for further instructions.

If you have any questions or would like to clarify any details, please email lyz@feedr.co.

Good luck!

### Notes

1. Create a basic folder structure for `screens`, `components` and `state`

2. Items from `ItemPicker` and `MenuPreview` could potentially be defined as different components

3. `App.css` has been split into respective `styled-components`

4. `redux-persist` has been used to keep the state after refresh

5. If config changes were allowed, I would implement path aliases for convenience

6. Tests has been written for all the components, reducer and selectors

7. For the production-ready application I would also consider design and translations system and introduce types
